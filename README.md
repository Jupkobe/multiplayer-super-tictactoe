## How to Play
### To try online
Go to [sxox.onrender.com](https://sxox.onrender.com). Wait couple of seconds for server to start. Then invite a friend and enjoy!
 

### To run the game on your local
1. Run this command in client folder:
`npm run dev`

2. Run this command in server folder:

3. Once server started, you can create or join a room.

## Technical Details
### Frontend
I used Vite.js with TailwindCSS for the frontend and React-Router for invite URL generations.

### Backend
I used Express.js and Socket.io for WebSocket configuration and Cors for handling outer header requests.
